                        Draped in green and guarded by a wall of Himalayas, it isn’t a surprise to know that Uttarakhand is fondly referred to as the ‘Land of Gods’. The diverse and bountiful state that is now a popular tourist destination was brought to fame by the Beatles’ 1968 visit. People around the country have travelled far and wide for the much feted Ganga Aarti – a spiritual gathering around the sacred Ganges River.
